    "Ans\t:Guido van Rossum\n",
    "Q.2\t:which type of programming does python support\n",
    "Ans\t:Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported\n",
    "Q.3\t:is python case sensitive while dealing with identifiers\n",
    "Ans\t:Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.\n",
    "Q.4\t:what is the correct extension of the python file\n",

    "Q.5\t:is python is compiled or interpreted\n",
    "Ans\t:Python is an interpreted language, which means the source code of a Python program is converted into bytecode that is then executed by the Python virtual machine. Python is different from major compiled languages, such as C and C + +, as Python code is not required to be built and linked like code for these languages\n",
    "Q.6\t:name a few blocks of code to define  in python language\n",
    "Ans\t:A block is a piece of Python program text that is executed as a unit. The following are blocks: a module, a function body, and a class definition. Each command typed interactively is a block.\n",
    "Q.7\t:state a symbol to give single line comment in python\n",
    "Ans\t:Comments in Python begin with a hash mark ( # ) and whitespace character and continue to the end of the line.\n",
    "Q.8\t:mention fuction which help us to find the version of python\n",
    "Ans\t:Using sys. version method.Using python_version() function.Using Python -V command.\n",
    "Q.9 :python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime using a construct called\n",
    "Ans\t:Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called \"lambda\" .\n",
    "Q.10:what does pip stand for python\n",

    "Q.11:mention a few built in functions in python\n",
    "Ans\t:\n",
    "    print( ) function\n",
    "\ttype( ) function\n",
    "\tinput( ) function\n",
    "\tabs( ) function\n",
    "\tpow( ) function\n",
    "\tdir( ) function\n",
    "\tsorted( ) function\n",
    "\tmax( ) function\n",
    "\tround( ) function\n",
    "\tdivmod( ) function\n",
    "\tid( ) function\n",
    "\tord( ) function\n",
    "\tlen( ) function\n",
    "\tsum( ) function\n",
    "\thelp( ) function\n",
    "Q.12: what is the maximum length of a python identifier\n",
    "Ans\t:nswer: An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages.\n",
    "Q.13: what is the benefits of using python\n",
    "Ans\t:Data science\n",
    "\tScientific and mathematical computing\n",
    "\tWeb development\n",
    "\tFinance and trading\n",
    "\tSystem automation and administration\n",
    "\tComputer graphics\n",

    "\tGeneral and application-specific scripting\n",
    "\tMapping and geography (GIS software)\n",
    "Q.14: how is memory managed in python\n",
    "Ans: Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.\n",
    "Q.15 : How to install python and set path variables for window?\t\n",
    "Ans\t1. Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.\n",
    "\t2. Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.\n",
    "\t3. Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.\n",
    "\t4. In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.\n",
    "\t5. Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.\n",
    "Q.16 :\tis indentation required in \n",
    "Ans\t:Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.\n",
